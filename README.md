# Working on PyTorch projects! 
* Planning to do a simple network using pytorch ( an image cnn )
* Also looking into doing an AI sonar processing model whitepaper with some buddies
* Final capstone will be making a transformer architecture from scratch and trying to get HyperGator access to train it using the remote server. ( i need to finish learning about VPS and ssh / ssl protocols first)
